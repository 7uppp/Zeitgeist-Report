# Monthly Report #202207 [Zeitgeist Update: July 2022]

We’ve been overwhelmed by the support shown to us by our community after the successful deployment of our Token Generation Event (TGE) and subsequent Token Transferability Event (TTE), with understandable enthusiasm felt throughout the ecosystem. 

In order to ensure that we provide the best possible product to users, we’ve been focusing heavily on the optimization of the application and strategizing a new marketing campaign to coincide with launch. We’re getting ever closer to that launch, and soon you’ll be able to experience our prediction market app first hand, and get a comprehensive understanding of what we’ve been working on for so long.

Here’s a rundown of what we’ve been working on in July… 

## TECH

### Protocol

We made numerous improvements ahead of our app launch, primarily security related, and submitted a total of 123 Github commits. Here are the key updates:
