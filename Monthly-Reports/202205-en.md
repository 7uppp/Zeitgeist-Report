# Monthly Report #202205 [Zeitgeist Update: May 2022]

Coming out of the end of April and leading into Mayï¼Œwe had no less than two rounds of code audits that were completed and have fixed most of the issues raised.
Additionally, we're extremely proud to be one of the supporters for the <a href="https://blog.zeitgeist.pm/zeitgeist-offers-30-000-in-bounties-for-polkadot-hackathon/" target="_blank">Polkadot Global Hackathon</a>, and are offering $30,000 in bounties to  three teams who produce innovative predictions-based tech.

### SDK

The SDK is relatively stable this month and we're excited that the groundwork was already done in April in order to be ready for the Polkadot Hackathon. The version was upgraded from the v0.5.1 iteration to v0.5.2. Only one commit was submitted:


- Upgrade to zeitgeist-v0.3.0 & Release SDK v0.5.2ï¼ˆ[#180](https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/tools/commit/ff65bd7a54c027d3660c83e32ceac82a3b0d6642)ï¼‰



### App optimization

Much of our work this month was around the optimization of the app, with a total of 59 commitments made in this regard.


### Marketing

 - Our marketing (and specifically design team) have been hard at work designing a brand new landing page website for zeitgeist.pm - with it going live pretty soon (just in time to coincide with app launch of course ðŸ˜‰).
 
 - The blog has been back in action, and there has been some great content put out, with Numa's piece about the <b>practicial outworkings of Futarchy</b> being an important highlight.

 - Further blog material is being prepared in conjunction with our app launch, and includes practical introductions to Prediction Markets, and how to use our application.

 - These blogs will also be accompanied with some video content, with many of the marketing team working on various tutorial videos to make the complicated nature of prediction markets seem more digestible to newer users.

 - A significant partnership we are absolutely delighted to be working on is that of the Exiled Racers NFT project. What the team at EXR are doing is groundbreaking, and we're excited to offer some predictions on their fantasy-style racing game.

 - These of course are all in conjunction with the primary focus which is a launch Marketing Campaign to coincide with our app launch, and making sure we reach as many users as possible with the news of launch day!
 


### Other developments

- The code audit was officially completed, and changes are being made to certain repos that need to be modified before mainnet launch. (We'll be announcing who performed those code audits within the next few weeks. ðŸ˜‰)

- The app's code itself will be open-sourced soon! Furthermore, the code for our Kusama Derby Beta App is now open-sourced to provide developers with an SDK use example. Anyone can fork <a href="https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/derby" target="_blank">this repo</a> and tinker to their heart's content!

- The new version of our documentation has been launched, and a large number of documents including SDK and app tutorials have been fully updated.

- OnFinality and Dwellir nodes have been now been offered to ensure node stability.


### Conclusion

And so June has crept up on us like a sneaking prediction meant to go the other direction. It feels like it's come out of nowhere! We've been incredibly busy at Zeitgeist doing our best to launch asap. And as you can see by all of our activity in this last month alone, that launch is certainly not long away now. ðŸ˜‰
