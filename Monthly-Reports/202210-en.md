# Monthly Report #202210

In October, the Zeitgeist team was hard at work improving the overall prediction market product. This is a perpetual process, but is a top priority right now as we look to ensure the application runs as smoothly as possible for crypto native and inexperienced users alike. Part of that improvement process is page and data load times, which means tweaking our Subsquid integration; while the other part is ensuring liquidity pools adequately serve both the market creators as well as the market participants - this specifically is an evolving process which requires dynamic adaptation to how users are making use of the application.

In addition to app improvements, our primary marketing event in October was a "Launch Party" event in Decentraland, which attracted almost 1,000 users in only three days. The event saw numerous crypto enthusiasts join us in Decentraland where many of them were excited to hear about what we are doing with prediction markets, especially PM-based governance. Before we get into the details of this event, let's run through everything else that went on within the Zeitgeist ecosystem last month...

### Additional Tech Notes

- In addition to all of the above work our engineering team have churned out, we've also added "market creation criteria" and "normative contribution rules" to the Zeitgeist docs, which are helpful resources if you're looking to dive deeper into our protocol and application! (https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist#readme)

## Marketing

Marketing efforts are moving at a steady pace, as our tech team readies the application for wider user participation. There are also some other milestones we're looking to achieve before ramping up marketing efforts that will take Zeitgeist beyond merely the Polkadot ecosystem. 

As mentioned, our primary marketing endeavour in October was that of the "App Launch Party" held in Decentraland. Hosted by (https://twitter.com/MetaGamiMall ) the event saw just under 1000 participate and join us in the Metaverse. We gave away thousands of ZTG to numerous lucky participants, and also a couple of Zeitgeist metaverse wearables. There were a host of tweets from participating users, so if you were one of them, thank you for joining us and for your continued support!

The Zeitgeist App Launch Party in Decentraland was organised primarily by the Zeitgeist China community, and we want to thank our Chinese team as well as "MetaGamiMall" and "Decentraland China" for their assistance in making this event a memorable one!

In addition to the Decentraland event, we also have two speakers representing Zeitgeist at the imminent Polkadot Summit being held in San Francisco: Our CEO Logan and our Business Growth Consultant Devlin - good luck, gents!

A couple of other things to note from the marketing side:

- Our community program "The Zeitgeist Seer Community" ran a very successful meme competition, which they aptly called "Hallo Meme".
- Nova Wallet added Zeitgeist to its functionality feature suite.
- Bob (Head of Community Developemnt Program) and James (Marketing Communications) took part in an intriguing Twitter Space about Web 3 gaming with GameDAO
- The first Zeitgeist Improvement Proposal was posted!
- The Zeitgeist NFT campaign continues to go strong, with numerous prediction market participants earning a number of badges - there is more to come in this regard, so make sure you know the ins and outs (like checking out this blog post: https://blog.zeitgeist.pm/announcing-zeitgeist-launch-nfts/ )

## In Conclusion

In conclusion, it's been yet another busy month at Zeitgeist. Our growing team is as busy as ever, but it's all so worth it when we consider how powerful tool we already have on our hands, and in the hands of users any where in the world.
