# Monthly Report #202211

We power on, approaching the end of 2022 at full speed! It's been a crazy year for many of us, but at least we've had travel back, and we've been able to make new connections in real life and exchange ideas of how to build better blockchain products.

November was no different than most other months: Busy! But with Sub0 it was a little busier than usual for a lot of us, as our team had to prepare for the few days away from their computers. And of course, the FIFA World Cup arrived - so we've been having some fun with a few Prediction Markets there.

Here are the primary updates we can give you about what happened at Zeitgeist in November...

## Tech

### Protocol

Zeitgeist's engineering team continued to optimize the overall protocol code, and submitted a total of 96 commits. These are the main ones:

## Marketing

In terms of marketing, of course this is key to ensuring we attract users to our protocol and build an accurate forecasting tool. We're working as hard as ever to ensure the application is of the highest standard before really ramping up marketing efforts, but this doesn't change the fact we still want to display a strong brand presence to the Dotsama and overall crypto community. Here are some key updates from the Marketing Team:

- Launched The Zeitgeist Newsletter, which is a fortnightly email of the primary markets and activities in the PM ecosystem, including a Top Ten chart of the most active prediction markets by volume
- Our Lead Blockchain Engineer Harald Heckmann spoke at the Sub0 Conference in Lisbon
- Our Product and Biz Developer Devlin spoke at PolkadotSummit in San Fransisco
- We launched a small campaign around the FIFA World Cup, which included Twitter Spaces, live match predictions, and ZTG giveaways - this will run until the end of the tournament

## Conclusion

Overall, we're proud of everything we continue to achieve at Zeitgeist, and just want to keep building! It's important that during this time of crypto chaos we keep our heads down and continue to build as best as we can, getting input, advice and expertise from some fo the best in both the Prediction Market, Forecasting, Blockchain, and Software fields.

We continue to appreciate all of your support!
