# Monthly Report #202208

Like most other months here at Zeitgeist, August was another exciting one! We completed our final code audit in collaboration with Chaintroopers, and addressed all of the issues found.  We spent the rest of the month polishing the interface and ensuring it runs smoothly in preparation for a September app launch. This launch will also see some exciting incentive structures in place that we’re sure will excite even the most passive user.

## Tech

### Protocol

### Conclusion

It’s been another bumper month for us at Zeitgeist, and all efforts have been directed toward the launch of a smooth and fast application, coupled with a campaign that excites our community and rewards power users. 

We know it’s deep “bear market” territory in the crypto industry, and users can get frustrated by the lack of excitement and hype within the ecosystem, but we want to remind you that we’re not building for hype nor any specific market “cycle”: We’re building an application that provides a powerful decentralized forecasting tool. One that stands the test of time. We appreciate all of the support and patience shown to us by community members from around the world, and are excited to now be one more step closer to a protocol we can all be incredibly proud of!
